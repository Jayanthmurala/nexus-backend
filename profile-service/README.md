## üèÜ Badge System

### Badge Rarity Levels
- **Common**: Basic achievements (blue theme)
- **Rare**: Notable accomplishments (green theme)
- **Epic**: Significant achievements (purple theme)
- **Legendary**: Exceptional accomplishments (gold theme)

### Default Badge Definitions
The service includes 8 default badges required for student event creation:
1. Team Player
2. Leadership
3. Innovation
4. Problem Solver
5. Research Excellence
6. Community Impact
7. Outstanding Presentation
8. Top Contributor

### Badge Award Context
Badges can be awarded in context of:
- **Projects**: Linked to specific project IDs
- **Events**: Linked to specific event IDs
- **General**: Standalone achievements

## üîê Security & Authorization

### Role-Based Access
- **Students**: Manage own profile, view others, create personal projects
- **Faculty**: Full profile access, publication management, badge awarding
- **Admins**: User management, badge definitions, data export

### Data Isolation
- College-scoped data access
- Profile ownership validation
- Cross-service user identity verification

## üéØ Integration Points

### Auth Service Integration
- JWT validation via JWKS endpoint
- User identity resolution
- Role-based authorization

### Cross-Service References
- Badge awards reference project/event IDs from other services
- Profile data consumed by other services via API calls
- College member ID used as primary student identifier

## üìà Performance Features

- **Redis Caching**: Optional caching for frequently accessed data
- **Indexed Queries**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient data loading patterns

## üß™ Development

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Reset database (development only)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Deploy migrations (production)
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Database Connection**: Verify PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- **JWT Validation**: Ensure auth service JWKS endpoint is reachable
- **Redis Connection**: Non-fatal if Redis is unavailable (graceful fallback)
- **College Data**: Ensure college records exist before creating profiles

### Debug Logging
Set `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed logging of:
- JWT validation steps
- Database queries
- Cross-service API calls
- Cache operations
